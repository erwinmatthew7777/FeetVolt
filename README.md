Fruit-Powered Guitar Pedal

> An open-source DIY implementation of the Floravolt concept: a guitar effects pedal that uses fruit as a power source.

## 🎸 Project Overview
This project recreates the Floravolt pedal functionality using accessible components and 3D-printed parts. It allows musicians to experiment with bio-electrical signals from fruits/vegetables to modulate guitar effects.

## 📋 Features
- Fruit/vegetable powered voltage source
- [List your specific effects: distortion, tremolo, etc.]
- Modular design for easy experimentation
- 3D-printed enclosure and fruit holders
- Open-source schematics and documentation

## 🛠️ Quick Start
### Basic Requirements
- [List main components]
- 3D printer (or access to printing services)
- Basic soldering skills

### Building Steps
1. Print all STL files from `/3d-prints/`
2. Assemble circuit following schematics
3. Calibrate with chosen fruit
4. Rock out!

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `/documentation/` - Complete build guide and theory
- `/schematics/` - Circuit diagrams (KiCad and PDF)
- `/3d-prints/` - STL files for all printed parts
- `/bom/` - Bill of materials and sourcing guide

## 🍋 Fruit Compatibility
| Fruit/Vegetable | Voltage Range | Duration | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|----------|-------|
| Lemon          | 0.8-1.0V      | ~2 hours | Most stable |
| Potato         | 0.7-0.9V      | ~3 hours | High capacity |
| Apple          | 0.5-0.7V      | ~1 hour  | Quick depletion |
